              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Can I book a photography session with you?</span>
              <p>Of course! Reach out and lets talk about your goals, needs and vision for your projects!

                For more info, checkout my <a href="/shooting/#collaborations">collaborations</a> page.

              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Do you do trade (TFP) collaborations</span>
              <p>Yes! I collaborate a lot. As a creative and content creator, I’m always looking forward to shooting
                with new subjects to create new content to use for my OnlyFans and other platforms/medium, where I
                share my photography work.

                The types of subjects and concepts I usually collaborate with vary a lot depending on specific projects
                and request. In general, the main concepts I shoot are sexy glam, sexy sporty, boudoir, implied, nudes,
                bodyscapes and erotic.

              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">I’d love to shoot with you but I’m not a model, I’m a shy
                and/or I am not attractive, beautiful, sexy, young, bla bla… Can we shoot?</span>
              <p>Of course we can. Many models in my work are not professional models. One of the things I love most
                about photography is capturing the beauty of who is in front of the camera and empowering them to stop
                beating them themselves (just like you doing! :) ). It feel good to help someone feel good.

                True, professional models make the work easier most of the times because they are used to the camera,
                know how to move, know about hair, makeup, etc.. but, again, I really love helping “non-models” getting
                through this experience a lot.

                  First, thanks for the love! There are a few ways you can help:

                  <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Spread the word</span>, mention my work around, if you have friends that need boudoir or intimate photo
                    sessions, let them know about my work! Word of mouth if a powerful tool!</li>

            <li>
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Can you elaborate on how a photoshoot preparation looks like></span>
              <p>Preparing for a session is very important. Actually, I believe it's even more important!
                It's where most of the communication and decisions happen:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Introductions First!</span> - Before we start, I always ask
                  my collaborators and clients to fill a form. This for serves several purposes:
                  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" class="pb-3">
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Get to know more about you</span> Knowing the person I'm
                      shooting with is really important. Your likes, dislikes, personality goes, etc... all helps when
                      working together in finding concepts, styles and setting up the photo-shooting in a way that is the
                      most comfortable and personal as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Define goals</span> No everyone wants to do a photoshoot
                      for the same reasons. Understand the needs helps us to be on the same page and optimize for the goals
                      we are setting</li>
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Define boundaries and comfort zones</span> It's really
                      important that we define these before starting to brainstorm and collaborate on concepts. Intimate
                      photography is very personal and understanding the concepts, topics, comfort zones and all helps to
                      avoid unnecessary stress and builds trust/security because we are creating a safe zone where the
                      boundaries and dynamics are clearly set.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Clarify and iterate basic information</span> During the
                      process of filling the form, we'll go over some information that is important: expectations, usage of
                      images, crediting, sharing, etc... </li>
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Prepare a collaboration or release agreement:</span> The
                      information filled on the form will be used to create a collaboration/release agreement that we sign
                      in loco, before we start, so that we have the piece of mind of shooting with a written agreement/</li>
                    <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Start with the right foot!:</span> Ultimately, starting with
                      the right foot, with the right information and knowing all these things is really important to create
                      a trustful, transparent, respectful (yet fun) collaboration.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Discussing and picking concepts:</span> Now to the fun part!
                  During the days and weeks before the shoot, we'll work on what concepts we see for the
                  shoot, brainstorm on different types of outfits, locations, accessories, etc..
                  To help with the process, I usually create private boards on Pinterest where we can collect ideas,
                  proposals and the concepts that we are targeting for the shoot.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Setting the location and date:</span> This is very flexible
                  and depends a lot on the concepts we have in mind. In general, it can be anywhere from my home studio to
                  an outdoor location to your home or a rented location. The time and duration also depends on these factors
                  as well as everyone's availability and number of concepts that we are shooting.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Clear and timely communication:</span> Many things can happen
                  from the moment we selected a date & time and the shooting itself. It's ok and not a problem, as far as
                  we communicate any change of mind about the concepts/wardrobe, inability to shoot at the selected time
                  and location or really anything relevant.

        <h4 class="title-border text-center">Custom Requests</h4>
        <div>
          <p>That's a question that I get asked
            very often. How can I make a custom request? Let me try to break down on the most popular ones.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled text-left pt-3">
            <li>
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Can I book a photography session with you?</span>
              <p>Of course!</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Can I request specific shoot types or specific models?</span>
              <p>
                Sure! Although I'm not always able to fulfill all request, whenever possible, I do. I am always happy to
                consider specific concepts and discuss potential costs, that can vary depending on the shoot and all the
                real costs necessary to make it happen.
                It's very similar to requests for shooting with specific models. It really depends also on the model
                availability to shoot and shoot specific concepts.
                Feel free to reach out!

                etc..?</span>
              <p>
                Keep in mind that I'm, by no means, a professional on relationships at all. If you think I can be
                helpful in sharing my experience or 20+ years of marriage in an open and respectful relationship and
                my opinions, then sure! The best way for this is to subscribe to my OnlyFans and shoot me a message.

        <h4 class="title-border text-center">Adult Lifestyle</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Since I collaborate a lot with other members of the "lifestyle" and, a lot of same values around
            privacy and respect in these communities are also very important for me and my work. I thought I'd
            talk a bit more about it and what it means...
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled text-left pt-3">
            <li>
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Adult Lifestyle... What do you mean?</span>
              <p>
              One quick definition that I read somewhere summarizes
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Adult Lifestyle</span> as
              <quote>
                a term used to convey the adventurous practices of couples and singles that enjoy recreational
                sex with other consenting adults, otherwise known as swingers.
              </quote>
              </p>

              <p>
                I really like to think it as adults free to live their sexuality free of judgement or taboos,
                enabled to explore and be explored, respecting each other individuality, space, comfort zones
                and privacy.
              </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">What about adult lifestyle and photography?</span>
              <p>In a similar way to what mentioned about intimate photography, security, trust and respect are extremely
                important in the lifestyle community. Photographing lifestyle events or parties, like erotic or intimate
                photography, can produce sexually explicit content and everyone taking part of the session needs the peace
                of mind that their security and privacy will be violated.

                My policy is to always have an agreement with anyone involved defining how and what images can be used
                and/or shared, for what purposes and under what conditions. It can go from "hey, we are all exhibitionists
                and are happy to share it to the world" to "this is a private event and all of the images produced are
                private, not to share" to somewhere in between where only the non recognizable pictures are to share. The
                point is that everything is decided and agreed upon together. <u>My collaborators/partners/clients privacy
                  is my highest priority.</u>

              </p>
              <p>In a similar way to my erotic sessions, these sessions often produce sexually explicit images and
                for this reason, the majority of the images are kept private for private clients or shared only
                in a private way (on OnlyFans, for instance) upon everyone's consent. Most will never be shared on
                social platforms.
