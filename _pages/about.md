<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-4">Hello, Iâ€™m <span class="font-weight-bold">{{site.author.name}}</span></h3>


...and I'm the creative eye and mind behind the lenses of Joe Vega Photography. I'm
a photographer who specialized in sexy glam, boudoir, adult lifestyle and erotic photography.
I'm a firm believer in diversity and the idea that everyone should be free and
empowered to explore themselves and their sensuality, free of judgement, in a safe and
welcoming environment. That's a big theme in my photography... striving to capture intimate
moments in an artistic, yet natural, way.

This website is a collection of my creative work behind the camera and features samples
of work with professional as well as non-professional models, every day people that decided to 
challenge themselves and expose themselves in front of the camera, as well as couples,
individuals from the adult lifestyle and the kink communities. 

One question that I'm asked quite often is, how I got into this genre of photography or how
I got into photography at all. The answer is quite simple: "By accident". My wife is a MUA and
for quite some time she complained about the fact that very often she wouldn't have professional
pictures of her work. I decided to learn photography to make her happy. The jump from that to
glam and fashion photography was quite fast. Soon I was getting requests for boudoir and more
intimate photoshoots. 

During this new love for art and photography, I discovered another aspect of it: that, in the
process, I am given the opportunity to make women look and feel happy and sexy. To empower them. 
This feeling of empowerment is so strong and fulfilling, and I'm blessed to be part of it.
