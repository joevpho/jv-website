            Since I collaborate a lot with other members of the "lifestyle" and, a lot of same values around
            privacy and respect in these communities are also very important for me and my work. I thought I'd
            talk a bit more about it and what it means...

        <h4 class="title-border text-center">Adult Lifestyle... What do you mean?</h4>
          <p>
            One quick definition that I read somewhere summarizes
            <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Adult Lifestyle</span> as
            <quote>
              a term used to convey the adventurous practices of couples and singles that enjoy recreational
              sex with other consenting adults, otherwise known as swingers.

          I really like to think it as adults free to live their sexuality free of judgement or taboos,
          enabled to explore and be explored, respecting each other individuality, space, comfort zones
          and privacy.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title-border text-center">What about it and photography?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>In a similar way to what mentioned about intimate photography, security, trust and respect are extremely
            important in the lifestyle community. Photographing lifestyle events or parties, like erotic or intimate
            photography, can produce sexually explicit content and everyone taking part of the session needs the peace
            of mind that their security and privacy will be violated.

            My policy is to always have an agreement with anyone involved defining how and what images can be used
            and/or shared, for what purposes and under what conditions. It can go from "hey, we are all exhibitionists
            and are happy to share it to the world" to "this is a private event and all of the images produced are
            private, not to share" to somewhere in between where only the non recognizable pictures are to share. The
            point is that everything is decided and agreed upon together. <u>My collaborators/partners/clients privacy
            is my highest priority.</u>

          </p>
          <p>In a similar way to my erotic sessions, these sessions often produce sexually explicit images and
            for this reason, the majority of the images are kept private for private clients or shared only
            in a private way (on OnlyFans, for instance) upon everyone's consent. Most will never be shared on
            social platforms.
