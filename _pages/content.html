          <h4 class="text-center">OnlyFans</h4>
            <p>
              OnlyFans is probably the easiest and most complete place where you can have access my work. That's where
              I often drop my photography shoots, my writings, content from my lifestyle and kink communities
              experiences as well as content with my wife.

              That's quite the variety of content and there can be a mix of professional quality [photography] content
              as well as more "raw" material, especially for content that relates to the lifestyle,
              created with closer friends or upon request. Nevertheless, most of the content is of the former, high quality
              content.

          <p>It's a work in progress to provide easier
            and faster ways to buy prints directly. For the moment, I'm accepting custom requests directly. Feel
            free to contact me through the contact form.</p>

          <div>
            <p>That's a question that I get asked
              very often. How can I make a custom request? Let me try to break down on the most popular ones.

                <p>
                  One of the main services I offer is custom photoshoots, taylored and executed based on my clients
                  vision and requests. Please check out my
                  <a href="/shooting/#collaborations">collaborations</a> and
                  <a href="/faq/">faq</a> pages for more info.

                <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Can I request specific types of shoots or specific models?</span>
                <p>
                  Yes! I do photoshoots and concepts based on the request of my clients looking for content. My clients
                  can both request a specific concept or type and ask if I could shoot with a specific model. The price
                  for these requests vary on many factors (type of shoot, rates of the model, if it's a private request
                  or if the content can be used on both my and the models platforms (i.e., OnlyFans) for other users
                  as well, etc. So please, if you have requests don't hesitate to <a href="/contact/">reach out.</a>
